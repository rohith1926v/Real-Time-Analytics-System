## Project Overview

**Real-Time Streaming Analytics Platform** is a fully local, open-source, production-style AI SOC/XDR system that processes cybersecurity telemetry in real time.

The platform simulates enterprise telemetry, streams it through Kafka, enriches it with Spark Structured Streaming, applies ML-based anomaly detection, correlates incidents, maps detections to MITRE ATT&CK, enriches entities with local threat intelligence, and presents the results through a polished React dashboard and FastAPI APIs.

It is designed to demonstrate practical experience across:

- real-time telemetry processing
- distributed streaming analytics
- AI/ML anomaly detection
- cybersecurity analytics and SOC workflows
- threat intelligence correlation
- observability and platform health monitoring
- Dockerized microservices architecture

Everything runs locally with free/open-source tools. No paid APIs, managed cloud services, or external SaaS dependencies are required.

## Key Features

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-Time Telemetry Ingestion** | Generates synthetic cybersecurity, login, API, network, and anomaly telemetry. |
| **Kafka Streaming Pipeline** | Uses Kafka topics for telemetry, analytics, ML predictions, alerts, and dead-letter handling. |
| **Spark Streaming Analytics** | Performs structured streaming transformations, aggregations, and feature engineering. |
| **ML Anomaly Detection** | Uses Isolation Forest inference over engineered telemetry features. |
| **Threat Intelligence Engine** | Performs local IOC enrichment, entity profiling, threat scoring, and attack timeline construction. |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** | Maps detections to tactics, techniques, MITRE IDs, and kill-chain stages. |
| **Detection Engineering** | Supports Sigma-like YAML detection rules and rule hit analytics. |
| **Incident Correlation** | Groups related alerts into incidents with severity escalation and timelines. |
| **Real-Time Alerting** | Streams live SOC alerts and incident updates through FastAPI WebSockets. |
| **Search + Persistence** | Stores structured records in PostgreSQL, indexes searchable data in Elasticsearch, and caches latest values in Redis. |
| **Observability** | Exposes Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for service and pipeline monitoring. |
| **Enterprise Dashboard** | React + TypeScript dashboard for SOC analytics, threat hunting, entities, alerts, incidents, and system health. |
| **Dockerized Microservices** | Runs as a local Docker Compose platform with full and laptop-friendly startup modes. |

<details>
<summary><strong>Detailed Data Flow</strong></summary>

1. Synthetic producers emit telemetry into Kafka topics.
2. Spark Structured Streaming consumes telemetry and produces enriched analytics and feature streams.
3. ML inference consumes analytics topics and publishes anomaly predictions.
4. The alert engine evaluates prediction and analytics streams to create SOC alerts and incidents.
5. The threat intelligence engine enriches activity with local IOC feeds, MITRE mappings, rule hits, and entity risk profiles.
6. PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch persist structured, cached, and searchable records.
7. FastAPI exposes REST and WebSocket APIs.
8. React visualizes dashboards, alerts, incidents, threat intelligence, MITRE coverage, entities, timelines, and observability.
9. Prometheus and Grafana provide platform health and metrics visibility.
